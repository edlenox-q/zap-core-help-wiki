# Add-ons #

Add-ons add additional functionality to ZAP.
They have full access to all of the ZAP internals, and so can provide very powerful new features.
You can dynamically install add-ons from the online Add-on Marketplace via the [Manage Add-ons dialog][].
You can typically add and remove add-ons to and from the ZAP UI without having to restart it.


Add-ons can provide context sensitive help which is dynamically integrated with the help file.
If you are reading this page via a ZAP help file (as opposed to reading it online) then any help pages associated with the add-ons you have installed will be available under [here][].


Add-ons are assigned a status which may be one of:

<table> 
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
   <td> Release</td>
   <td>which indicates they are of high quality and fit for purpose</td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
   <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
   <td> Beta</td>
   <td>which indicates they are of reasonable quality but may be incomplete or need further testing</td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
   <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
   <td> Alpha</td>
   <td>which indicates they are at an early stage of development</td>
  </tr> 
 </tbody>
</table>
