# Scanner Rules #

ZAP supports both [active][] and [passive][] scanning rules.

All rules are contained in [add-ons][] so that they can be updated quickly and easily.
By default ZAP ships with just the 'Release' quality rules, but you can install 'Beta' and 'Alpha' quality rules via the [Manage Add-ons dialog][].

[Scan Policies][] define which rules run and how they run.
You can have as many scan policies as you like to cover different situations.

To manage scan policies open the [Scan Policy Manager dialog][]
