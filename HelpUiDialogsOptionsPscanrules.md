# Options Passive Scan Rules screen #

This screen allows you to configure the [passive scan][] rules.


### Threshold ###

This controls how likely ZAP is to report potential vulnerabilities.
If you select Low then more potential issues will be raised which may increase the number of false positives.
If you select High then fewer potential issues will be raised which may mean that some real issues are missed (false negatives).
