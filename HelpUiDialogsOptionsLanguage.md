# Options language screen #

The language screen allows you to configure:

### Language selection ###

The language ZAP uses for its display.
A set of languages are built into ZAP, however more languages may be available after the last release.
Check the ZAP download page for the latest language pack available.


### Language pack import ###

Besides the selection of the language that is used for ZAP's display, the import tool enables you to import new language packs or language file updates. A language file pack will always have the extension *zaplang*. (E.g. language-pack-en\_GB.zaplang)
After the import you will immediately be able to select the newly imported language from the language selection drop down menu on the top of the screen.
**Note that you will need to restart ZAP in order to finally apply the new language.**
