The nodes can be included again via the *Session Properties* dialog

This will prevent the selected notes from being actively scanned.
The nodes can be included again via the *Session Properties* dialog

### Resend... ###

This will bring up the *Resend dialog* which allows you to resend the request after making any changes to it that you want to.

### New Alert... ###

This will bring up the *Add Alert dialog* which allows you to manually record a new *alert* against this request.

### Open URL in Browser ###

This will open the URL of the selected node in your default browser.
