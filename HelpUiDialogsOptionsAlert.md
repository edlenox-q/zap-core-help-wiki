# Options Alerts screen #

This screen allows you to configure the alerts options:

### Merge related alerts in report ###

If selected then related issues will be merged in any reports generated.
This will significantly reduce the size of the report as duplicated information will be removed.

### Max alert instances in report ###

The maximum number of alert instances to include in a report.
A value of zero is treated as unlimited.
