# Spider tab #

The Spider tab shows you the set of unique URIs found by the [Spider][] during the scans.

The 'New Scan' button launches the [Spider dialog][] which allows you to specify exactly what should be scanned.
The Spider can be run on multiple Sites in parallel and the results for each scan are shown by selecting the scan via the 'Progress' pull-down.

The toolbar provides a set of buttons which allow you to start, stop, pause and resume the scan. A progress bar shows how far the scan selected via the Progress pull-down has progressed.


For each request you can see:

 *  Processed - Whether the URI was processed by the Spider or was skipped from fetching because of a rule (e.g. it was out of scope)
 *  Method - The HTTP method, e.g. GET or POST, through which the resource should be accessed
 *  URI - the resource found
 *  Flags - any information about the URI (e.g. if it's a seed or why was it not processed)
