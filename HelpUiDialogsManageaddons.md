# Manage Add-ons #

This allows you to manage the [add-ons][] that you have installed and download new ones from the Add-on Marketplace.

Two tabs are available:

## Installed ##

This tab shows you the version of ZAP you are running, all of the installed add-ons and allows you to check for any updates to ZAP or any of the add-ons.
Hovering over an add-on will show you more information about it.
You can also uninstall add-ons from this tab - typically add-ons are dynamically removed from the ZAP UI as soon as you uninstall them.

## Marketplace ##

This tab shows you all of the add-ons that you dont have installed which are available from the Add-on Marketplace.
You will need to 'Check for updates' before you can see the add-ons available.
Hovering over an add-on will show you more information about it.
You can install any of the add-ons listed - typically add-ons are dynamically added to the ZAP UI as soon as you install them.
