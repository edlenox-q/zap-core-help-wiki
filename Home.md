# OWASP ZAP User Guide #

Welcome to the The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) User Guide.

This is available both as context sensitive help within ZAP and online at https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki

ZAP is an easy to use integrated penetration testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications.

It is designed to be used by people with a wide range of security experience and as such is ideal for developers and functional testers who are new to penetration testing.

ZAP provides automated scanners as well as a set of tools that allow you to find security vulnerabilities manually.

If you are new to ZAP then its recommended that you look at the [Getting Started][] section.

ZAP is a fork of the open source variant of the [Paros Proxy][].
