# Tags #

A tag is short piece of text that you wish to associate with a request.
A request can have multiple tags associated with it.
Tags can be added and changed using the [Manage Tags dialog][].
They can also be automatically added via [Passive scanning][] \- this allows you to automatically tag pages which match a particular regular expression.


Tags are shown in the [History tab][] and can be filtered on using the [History Filter dialog][].
